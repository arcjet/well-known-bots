# Well Known Bots

This repository contains a list of Well Known Bots, including robots, crawlers,
validators, monitors, and spiders, in a single JSON file. Each bot is identified
and provided a RegExp `pattern` to match against an HTTP `User-Agent` header.
Additional metadata is available on each item.

## Realities

It's impossible to create a system that can detect all bots. Well-behaving bots
identify themselves in a consistent manner, usually via the User-Agent patterns
this project provides. It is straightforward to identify these well-behaving
bots, but misbehaving bots pretend to be real clients and use various mechanisms
to evade detection.

browser-fingerprinting][non-tech-notes-url] project.

## Structure

Each entry in the JSON represents a specific bot or crawler and includes the following fields:

- id: A unique identifier for the bot
- categories: An array of categories the bot belongs to (e.g., "search-engine", "advertising")
- pattern: A regular expression pattern used to identify the bot in user agent strings
- url: (optional) A URL with more information about the bot
- verification: A list of supported methods for verifying the bot's identity (if the bot is not verifiable it should be empty).
- instances: An array of example user agent strings for the bot
- aliases: Extra unique identifiers for the bot that can be used to identify it across other data sources

### Verification

Each verification entry contains the following fields:

- type: The method of verification (`dns` and `cidr` are supported)

If you specify `dns` verification then these fields are expected:

- masks: An array of mask patterns used for verification

If you specify `cidr` verification then these fields are expected:

- sources: An array of sources to pull cidr range data from (at least one is required)

### Verification mask patterns

The mask patterns use the following special characters:

- *: Represents 0 or 1 of any character
- @: Acts as a wildcard, matching any number of characters

All other characters in the mask require an exact match.

### Cidr verification sources

Each cidr source requires the following fields:

- type: The type of source (Currently only `http-json`) is supported
- url: The url that hosts the ip ranges
- selector: A JsonPath selector that selects all of the IP ranges in the source
